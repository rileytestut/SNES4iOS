SNES (HD) is a Super Nintendo emulator for the Apple iPad.  It is designed to be controlled by an iPhone application named ControlPad, available at http://github.com/WoozleWrangler/ControlPad or in binary form from the Cydia repository http://wherethewoozlewasnt.com/cydia 

Some features include:
  * Fullscreen graphics
  * iPhone/iPod touch controllers
  * Up to four controllers at a time
  * Save state preview screenshots

SNES (HD) is based on ZodTTD's port of Snes9x called snes4iphone.  I have altered most of the Objective C code to suit my tastes and the differences between platforms, and have redesigned the user interface.  Zod's port can be accessed at http://github.com/zodttd/snes4iphone and is available in ad-supported and commercial versions from the Cydia store.

*** About building the project ***
Please note that the Xcode project DOES NOT WORK!  It's included because I like using the
Xcode IDE for objective C code.  To edit the code for the emulator itself (contained in src/snes4iphone),
you'll need another text editor (I use TextMate). 
You have to use the Makefile in the top level of the source directory.  
A simple "make" will result in a ControlPad.app directory which you can ssh over
to your iPad.  Note that you must have ldid installed on your system for the fake
codesigning.  If ldid is not in /usr/local/bin, you'll also need to change the LDID
variable in the makefile.  Also please note that if you add any classes, you'll have to
add them to the OBJS variable in the Makefile.  Likewise with Interface Builder .xib files -
you'll need to add the filename, with the ".nib" extension to the NIB_FILES variable.

If you set the SSH_DESTINATION to something appropriate for your machine, you can
do a "make transfer" and it will copy the bundle over to your machine.  Mine is set to
root@ipad:/Applications because "ipad" is the name of my iPad on my local network. 
If you set it to the hostname or ip address of your iPad, it makes testing a lot easier.
Make sure you keep the ":/Applications" part.  If you don't want scp to prompt you for your
iPad's password every time, add your public key to the iPad's root users' .ssh/authorized_keys file.
There's a good tutorial on how to do that here: http://www.petefreitag.com/item/532.cfm


If you want to make a .deb package, type "make package" and it will create SNES-HD.deb  

Finally, I just added a file called "logwrapper.sh" to the Resources directory.  This will
be copied over to the app bundle, and if you edit SNES4iPad-Info.plist and change the value
for CFBundleExecutable from "SNES-HD" to "logwrapper.sh", when you run the app all output from
stdout and stderr are redirected to "/tmp/snes-hd.log".  This is very useful when debugging, as
there's no way I know of to attach a GDB session to a jailbreak app.  Just run "tail -f /tmp/snes-hd.log"
in an ssh session.
